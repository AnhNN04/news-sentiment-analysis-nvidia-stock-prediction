An attendee wears a face mask while taking a selfie in front of the Welcome To Fabulous Las Vegas sign on the show floor during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) on January 6, 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada. - The CES tech show threw open its doors Wednesday in Las Vegas despite surging Covid-19 cases in the United States, as one of the world's largest trade fairs tried to get back to business.
