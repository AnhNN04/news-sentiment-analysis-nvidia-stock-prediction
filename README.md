# News Sentiment Analysis and Nvidia Stock Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to analyze news sentiment related to Nvidia and predict its stock price movement. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assess sentiment in news articles and machine learning models to forecast stock prices, this project provides insights into the correlation between market sentiment and stock performance.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**:
   - News articles related to Nvidia are gathered using APIs (e.g., Finnhub, Yahoo Finance) from sources like news websites and stock market platforms.
   - Stock price data for Nvidia is collected from sources like Yahoo Finance or Finnhub API.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to process news articles and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral using pre-trained models like `VADER` or Hugging Face's transformers.
   
3. **Stock Price Prediction**:
   - Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) models (such as LSTM or XGBoost) are applied to predict Nvidia's stock price based on the sentiment scores and historical stock data.

4. **Visualization**:
   - The relationship between sentiment and stock performance is visualized using tools like Tableau or Grafana to provide real-time dashboards.

## Tech Stack
